            During hair transplant procedure, hairs are first extracted from the regions of the head that show resistance to baldness. After that, these resistant strands are implanted on the bald patches seen on the scalp. The process works because hair taken from the areas with resistance to baldness will remain resistant to baldness wherever they are placed. Hair transplant gives natural and permanent results.
